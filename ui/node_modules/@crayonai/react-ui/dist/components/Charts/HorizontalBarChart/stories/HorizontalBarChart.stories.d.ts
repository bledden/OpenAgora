/**
 * # HorizontalBarChart Component Documentation
 *
 * The HorizontalBarChart is a versatile component for comparing values across different categories in a horizontal layout.
 * It's highly effective for:
 *
 * - **Category Comparison**: Easily compare metrics like sales, performance, or revenue across different groups.
 * - **Ranking**: Show the highest and lowest performing items with a clear visual hierarchy.
 * - **Data with Long Labels**: Perfect for datasets with lengthy category names that don't fit well in vertical layouts.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * ### Layout Variants
 * - **Grouped**: Compare sub-categories side-by-side within a primary category.
 * - **Stacked**: Show how sub-categories contribute to a total value for each primary category.
 *
 * ### Interactive & Responsive
 * - **Vertical Scrolling**: Automatically enables scrolling when the number of bars exceeds the container height.
 * - **Interactive Legend**: Toggle data series on and off. Handles overflow with a "Show More" button.
 * - **Hover Tooltips**: Provides detailed data on hover for better user engagement.
 * - **Responsive Design**: Adjusts gracefully to the size of its container.
 *
 * ### Customization
 * - **Theming**: Six built-in color palettes, or use custom colors with `customPalette`.
 * - **Bar Styling**: Customize the corner radius of the bars.
 * - **Axis and Grid Control**: Toggle visibility of axes and grid lines.

/**
 * ## Comprehensive Data Explorer
 *
 * This story serves as a comprehensive test suite for the HorizontalBarChart component.
 * Use the buttons to switch between various datasets designed to test edge cases in:
 *
 * - **Data Volume**: Scenarios with few, many, or a single data point.
 * - **Data Formatting**: Handling of large numbers and different value ranges.
 * - **Legend Overflow**: A dataset with many series to test legend expand/collapse functionality.
 *
 * It's an excellent tool for developers to see how the chart behaves under different conditions.
