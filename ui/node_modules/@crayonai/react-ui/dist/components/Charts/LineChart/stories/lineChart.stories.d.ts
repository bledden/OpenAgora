/**
 * # LineChart Component Documentation
 *
 * The LineChart component is a powerful and flexible tool for visualizing trends over time or comparing continuous data.
 * It's ideal for:
 *
 * - **Time-Series Analysis**: Tracking metrics over days, months, or years.
 * - **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing the performance of multiple data series.
 * - **Trend Identification**: Spotting upward or downward trends, and patterns in datasets.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * ### Advanced Label Handling
 * - **Collision Detection**: Automatically detects and prevents overlapping X-axis labels.
 * - **Intelligent Truncation**: Truncates long labels with an ellipsis (...) to keep the chart clean.
 * - **Horizontal Offset**: Ensures truncated labels remain horizontally centered for readability.
 *
 * ### Interactive & Responsive
 * - **Interactive Legend**: Allows toggling data series visibility and adapts with a "Show More" feature for many items.
 * - **Hover Tooltips**: Provides detailed data points on hover for enhanced user interaction.
 * - **Responsive Design**: Fluidly adjusts to any container size, from small widgets to large dashboards.
 *
 * ### Customization
 * - **Theming**: Six pre-built color palettes to fit your application's design, or use custom colors with `customPalette`.
 * - **Line Styles**: Supports `linear`, `natural` (smooth), and `step` variants.
 * - **Styling Options**: Control stroke width, grid visibility, and more.

/**
 * ## Comprehensive Data Explorer
 *
 * This story serves as a comprehensive test suite for the LineChart component.
 * Use the buttons to switch between various datasets designed to test edge cases in:
 *
 * - **Label Collision**: Datasets with long, dense, or overlapping labels.
 * - **Data Density**: Scenarios with few or many data points.
 * - **Legend Overflow**: A dataset with many series to test legend expand/collapse functionality.
 *
 * It's an excellent tool for developers to see how the chart behaves under different conditions.

 * ## Big Labels
 *
 * This story demonstrates the chart's ability to handle very long category labels.
 * The chart's intelligent truncation and collision detection should be visible here.
 * X-axis labels that are too long to fit will be gracefully truncated with an ellipsis.

 * ## Dense Timeline
 *
 * Tests how the chart handles many data points with medium-length period labels.

 * ## Line Variants

 * - **Linear**: Straight lines connecting data points.

/**
 * ## Legend Expand/Collapse

/**
 * ## Responsive Behavior Demo
 *
 * This story demonstrates the responsive capabilities of the LineChart. Drag the handles
 * on the container to resize it and observe how the chart adapts.
 *
 * **Responsive Features:**
 * - **Label Truncation**: More aggressive truncation on smaller container widths.
 * - **Layout Adaptation**: Chart elements adjust to fit the available space.
 * - **Legend Behavior**: The legend may wrap or show expand/collapse buttons as needed.
