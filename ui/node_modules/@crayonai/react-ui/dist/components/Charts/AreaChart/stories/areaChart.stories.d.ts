/**
 * # AreaChart Component Documentation
 *
 * The AreaChart is excellent for visualizing quantitative data and showing the volume of a metric over a progression.
 * It's ideal for:
 *
 * - **Time-Series Analysis**: Showing how a value or volume changes over time.
 * - **Showing Volume**: Emphasizing the magnitude of a value.
 * - **Comparing Trends**: Stacking areas to show how different series contribute to a total.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * ### Advanced Label Handling
 * - **Collision Detection**: Prevents X-axis labels from overlapping.
 * - **Intelligent Truncation**: Automatically shortens long labels with an ellipsis (...).
 * - **Horizontal Offset**: Ensures labels are correctly positioned for maximum readability.
 *
 * ### Interactive & Responsive
 * - **Interactive Legend**: Toggle data series visibility. It gracefully handles overflow with a "Show More" feature.
 * - **Hover Tooltips**: Choose between a standard tooltip or a floating one that follows the cursor.
 * - **Responsive Design**: Adapts fluidly to its container's size.
 *
 * ### Customization
 * - **Theming**: Comes with six pre-built color palettes.
 * - **Area Styles**: Supports `linear`, `natural` (smooth), and `step` interpolation.
 * - **Styling Options**: Control grid visibility, axes, and more.

 * ## Comprehensive Data Explorer
 *
 * This story serves as a comprehensive test suite for the AreaChart component.
 * Use the buttons to switch between various datasets designed to test edge cases in:
 *
 * - **Label Collision**: Datasets with long, dense, or overlapping labels.
 * - **Data Density**: Scenarios with few or many data points.
 * - **Legend Overflow**: A dataset with many series to test legend expand/collapse functionality.
 *
 * It's an excellent tool for developers to see how the chart behaves under different conditions.

 * ## Dense Timeline
 *
 * Tests how the chart handles many data points with medium-length period labels.

/**
 * ## Responsive Behavior Demo
 *
 * This story demonstrates the responsive capabilities of the AreaChart. Drag the handles

 *
 * **Responsive Features:**
 * - **Label Truncation**: More aggressive truncation on smaller container widths.
 * - **Layout Adaptation**: Chart elements adjust to fit the available space.
 * - **Legend Behavior**: The legend may wrap or show expand/collapse buttons as needed.
