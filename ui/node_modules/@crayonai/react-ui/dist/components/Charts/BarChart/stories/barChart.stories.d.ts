/**
 * # BarChart Component Documentation
 *
 * The BarChart is a versatile component for comparing values across different categories.
 * It's highly effective for:
 *
 * - **Category Comparison**: Easily compare metrics like sales, users, or revenue across different groups.
 * - **Ranking**: Show the highest and lowest performing items in a dataset.
 * - **Data Over Time**: Visualize changes across discrete time intervals (e.g., monthly sales).
 *
 * ## Key Features
 *
 * ### Layout Variants
 * - **Grouped**: Compare sub-categories side-by-side within a primary category.
 * - **Stacked**: Show how sub-categories contribute to a total value for each primary category.
 *
 * ### Interactive & Responsive
 * - **Horizontal Scrolling**: Automatically enables scrolling when the number of bars exceeds the container width.
 * - **Interactive Legend**: Toggle data series on and off. Handles overflow with a "Show More" button.
 * - **Hover Tooltips**: Provides detailed data on hover for better user engagement.
 * - **Responsive Design**: Adjusts gracefully to the size of its container.
 *
 * ### Customization
 * - **Theming**: Six built-in color palettes, or use custom colors with `customPalette`.
 * - **Bar Styling**: Customize the corner radius of the bars.
 * - **Axis and Grid Control**: Toggle visibility of axes and grid lines.

/**
 * ## Comprehensive Data Explorer
 *
 * This story serves as a comprehensive test suite for the BarChart component.
 * Use the buttons to switch between various datasets designed to test edge cases in:
 *
 * - **Data Volume**: Scenarios with few, many, or a single data point.
 * - **Data Formatting**: Handling of large numbers and different value ranges.
 * - **Legend Overflow**: A dataset with many series to test legend expand/collapse functionality.
 *
 * It's an excellent tool for developers to see how the chart behaves under different conditions.

 * ## Small Dataset (No Scroll)
 *
 * This story demonstrates the BarChart's appearance with a small dataset.
 * When the number of bars fits within the container width, horizontal scrolling is disabled.

 * ## Large Dataset (With Scrolling)

 * ## Big Numbers
 *
 * This story tests the chart's ability to handle and format very large numbers,

 * with appropriate suffixes (e.g., "B" for billion, "T" for trillion).

/**
 * ## Responsive Behavior Demo
 *
 * This story demonstrates the responsive capabilities of the BarChart. Drag the handles
 * on the container to resize it and observe how the chart adapts.
 *
 * **Responsive Features:**
 * - **Bar Sizing**: Bar widths and gaps adjust to the container size.
 * - **Layout Adaptation**: Chart elements are repositioned to fit the available space.
 * - **Legend Behavior**: The legend may wrap or show expand/collapse buttons as needed.
