 *
 * - The hook makes it incredibly easy to manage the thread and does not require you to implement a thread manager from scratch manually
 * - You can use the thread manager to load a thread from a backend API
 * - You can use the thread manager to process a message and request the agent for the response
 * - You can use the thread manager to update a message
